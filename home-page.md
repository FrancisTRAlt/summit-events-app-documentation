# What is Summit Events?

What is Summit Events?


Summit Events is an open-source, sustainable community events application designed to meet the diverse needs of educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. It provides flexible support for a wide range of event types, including paid or free events, group or individual registrations, and both guest and community-focused gatherings. 

Summit Events covers the full event lifecycle, from registration and payment processing to confirmations, reporting, and public-facing event pages.  Built on the Salesforce platform, the app supports connected campus experiences and is fully compatible with Salesforce.orgâ€™s data architectures.
