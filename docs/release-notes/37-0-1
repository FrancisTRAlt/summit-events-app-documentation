## Important Items and Upgrade Action Steps

Steps are identified as part of each release item. Please review and take appropriate actions once the upgrade is installed.

### Guest User Permissions to Update Post Installation/Upgrade
- With the latest update the Sharing Rule has become obsolete and not longer needed. This ensures the guest user only has contextual access to information. This was previously a require step during the setup and installation process, which is not longer needed. Follow the below steps to remove the Sharing Rule.
  - Go to "Sharing Settings" in Setup
  - Go to the "Summit Events Sharing Rules" where you should see the Sharing Rule for the Guest User initially created
  - Select "Del" to remove the Sharing Rule, this will prompt a confirmation winow explaining that the Sharing Rules will be recalulated.
  - After about 1 minute, refresh your page to verify that the Summit Events Sharing Rule has been removed.

- As part of this update the Summit Event Regitration Permission Set has also been updated. If you've created a cloned permissions set, you're encouraged to remove that permission set or create a new one based on the latest update. The step to do this has changed and the Guest User no longer needs access to the Account object via Permissions Set. If you've already created custom fields for the Guest Users access, you can simply remove the Read access to the Guest User.  
- Always be sure to follow [Guest User Best Practices](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.networks_guest_profile_best_practices.htm&type=5). Please reach out if you have questions or concerns.
