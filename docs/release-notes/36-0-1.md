## Important Items and Upgrade Action Steps

Steps are identified as part of each release item. Please review and take appropriate actions once the upgrade is installed.

### Page Layouts and Picklists to Update Post Installation/Upgrade
The following Lightning Layouts and Page Layouts may need to be updated to expose new fields leveraging new functionality/updates. Below we're sharing the API name, which has a matching label:

* Summit Events Questions object Page Layout
  * Add `Lookup_Order_By__c` field to allow ordering of lookup values.

---
## Known Issues
* None known as part of this release at this time.

## Functional Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

### Required Appointment ([#533](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/533))
Previously, required appointments would show as required (red asterisk) when landing on the page, but the validation would only highlight after attempting to proceed without making a selection. This has been corrected so that the validation occurs only if the registrant navigates away from the page without completing the required appointment.

*Post Deploy Instructions:* No action is required by an Administrator.

---

### Registration QR Image ([#562](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/562))
Google decommissioned the product used to generate registration QR codes, resulting in broken images. The QR code generation was rebuilt using [api.qrserver.com](https://api.qrserver.com).  

*Post Deploy Instructions:*  
Add `https://api.qrserver.com` as a New Trusted URL in **Setup > Trusted URLs**.

### Convert Registrant Date of Birth to Text ([#580](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/580))
A new `Registrant Date of Birth Text` field has been added to the Summit Events Registration object. The date field is transformed via code to `yyyy-mm-dd` format to allow duplicate matching rules on Contact where a similar text field exists—bypassing the Salesforce limitation of not creating matching rules on date fields.

*Post Deploy Instructions:*  
  - Create a record in **Custom Metadata Types > Summit Events Contact Matching Mapping** to enable a matching rule with this field.  
  - Update object-specific matching rules as needed.

---

### Add Order By Ability for Custom Questions ([#582](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/582))
A new `Lookup Order By` field on the Summit Events Questions Page Layout object allows more flexibility for displaying lookup values, which were previously ordered alphabetically.  
Example: Ordering terms for a university using both `Lookup Where Clause` and `Lookup Order By` fields.

*Post Deploy Instructions:* Add `Lookup_Order_By__c` field to the Summit Events Questions object Page Layout.

## Technical Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

### No-Show Status for One Registration per Event ([#586](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/586))
A new "No-Show" Registration Status has been added, allowing registrants marked as such to bypass the “One registration per instance” or “One registration per event” restrictions—similar to the existing “Started” or “Cancelled” statuses.

*Post Deploy Instructions:* No action is required.

---

### Accessibility and Dietary Fields Moved ([#592](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/592))
The Accessibility and Dietary Needs fields, introduced in a prior release, have been moved above the Mailing Address and Accommodations section for better visibility.

*Post Deploy Instructions:* No action is required.

---

### Letterheads Not Generating Correct Links ([#593](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/593))
Previously, letterhead images required manual updates to include `https://` in their URLs. The code has been updated so that correct links are generated automatically.

*Post Deploy Instructions:* No action is required.

---

### Event Instance Date/Time Field for Hosted Guests ([#597](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/597))
The `summit__Event_Instance_Date_Time_Formatted__c` field was not being populated for Hosted Guest registrations. This field is now correctly populated for both Registrants and Guests at record creation.

*Post Deploy Instructions:* No action is required.
