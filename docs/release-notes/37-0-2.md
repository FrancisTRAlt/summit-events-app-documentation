### Make Images in Rich Text Fields Public **Before Upgrading**
With this release, the **Guest User Sharing Rule** is no longer required, in line with Salesforce Guest User and Security Standards. This improves security by ensuring Guest Users only have contextual access to the information they need.  

However, this change also means images in **Rich Text Fields** are no longer automatically accessible as before. To prevent broken images in your active events, complete the following steps **before you upgrade**:

- **Ensure the *Files* Related List is Available**
  - The update does not automatically add the **Files** Related List to the Dynamic Page Layout. Add it manually:
    - Go to **Summit Events** object → **Page Layouts**.
    - Add the **Files** Related List to the layout.  
    - In your Lightning Page Layout, add the **Related List – Single** component for **Files**.

- **Make the Image Public**
  - Upload the original image to a **Files** record.
  - Open the uploaded image.
  - At the top of the page, click **Public Link**.
  - Follow the prompts to create the public link, then click **Create Link**.
  - Open the public link in a new browser tab.

- **Replace the Image in the Rich Text Field**
  - After creating the public link and opening it in a new tab:
    - Right-click the image and choose **Copy Image**.
    - In your Rich Text Field, right-click and choose **Paste**.  
      > This ensures the image is publicly accessible.

- **For Externally Hosted Images**
  - Ensure the external image is publicly accessible.
  - Right-click the external image, choose **Copy Image**, and paste it into the Rich Text Field.

### Guest User Permissions to Update **After Upgrading**
With this update, the **Guest User Sharing Rule** for the Summit Events object should be removed. This ensures Guest Users no longer have direct access to Summit Event records while still allowing the same registration functionality. This was previously required during setup and installation but is no longer needed.

**To remove the Guest User Sharing Rule:**
1. Go to **Sharing Settings** in Setup.
2. Find **Summit Events Sharing Rules** and locate the Sharing Rule for the Guest User that was initially created.
3. Click **Del** to remove the Sharing Rule.  
   > A confirmation window will explain that Sharing Rules will be recalculated.
4. Wait about 1 minute, then refresh the page to confirm the Summit Events Sharing Rule has been removed.

- As part of this update, Summit Event Registration permissions have been refined for improved security. If your registration flow uses **Lookup Fields** that require sharing certain records with the Guest User, follow [Guest User Best Practices](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.networks_guest_profile_best_practices.htm&type=5) and scope the Permission Set and Sharing Rules accordingly. Contact the Summit Events Team if you need assistance.

### Page Layouts and Picklists to Update Post Installation/Upgrade
As noted above, ensure the **Files** related list is present on your Page Layout after the upgrade.

- **Ensure the *Files* Related List is Available**
  - The update adds the **Files** Related List to the Dynamic Page Layout by default.  
  - If you use a custom layout:
    - Go to the **Summit Events** object → **Page Layouts**.
    - Add the **Files** Related List to the layout.  
    - In your Lightning Page Layout, add the **Related List – Single** component for **Files**.

<img width="946" height="227" alt="Files related list visible in Summit Events object page layout" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f8b9faa-95f7-438e-baa6-17baf54c47e1" />

## Previous Release
While this is Release 0.37.0.2, the prior Release 0.36.0.5 included several valuable updates you should review, as they are all included in this latest version.  
- [Release Notes for 0.36.0.5](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/release-notes/36-0-5/)

## Functional Features, Updates and Bug Fixes
This release is primarily technical, but the [previous release](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/release-notes/36-0-5/) included notable functional updates worth reviewing.

---

## Technical Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

### Improved Guest User Security Compliance
The Summit Events App now uses a more secure approach for Guest User access, ensuring full compliance with **Salesforce Guest User and Security Standards**. As part of this update, the **Guest User Sharing Rule** on the Summit Events object is no longer required and should be removed. This change prevents Guest Users from having direct access to Summit Event records while preserving the same registration functionality as before.  

> **Important:** Because this change also affects how images in Rich Text Fields are accessed, any images used in your event pages must be publicly accessible before upgrading. See the “Make Images in Rich Text Fields Public Before Upgrading” section above for detailed steps.

### Deprecated Unused and Unmanaged Solutions
The **Parking Pass** and **Host Assignment** classes have been deprecated. These were legacy components from when Summit Events originated at the University of St. Thomas and are no longer maintained or in use.
