# 🧪 Summit Events App Testing Guide  
**Focus: Person Account Matching + Core Event Functionality**

---

## 🔍 Overview

This test covers a new release of the **Summit Events App**, with reengineered **Person Account Matching logic**. Though core capabilities remain the same, the matching engine has been streamlined for performance and accuracy. Testers will install the package, configure matching logic, simulate real-world registrations, and validate both core and advanced event functionality.

This package is **not upgradeable** and is intended for **throwaway testing only**. Please test in a **scratch org or new developer org only**.

---

## ✅ Before You Begin

Create a new org from one of the options below:

| Org Type | Link | Person Accounts Enabled |
|----------|------|--------------------------|
| Standard Dev Org | https://developer.salesforce.com/free-trials | ❌ No |
| Education Cloud Dev Org | https://developer.salesforce.com/free-trials/comparison/education-cloud | ✅ Yes |
| Nonprofit Cloud Dev Org | https://developer.salesforce.com/free-trials/comparison/nonprofit-cloud | ✅ Yes |

You may wish to test across org types to evaluate Person Account behaviors.

## 📦 Step 1: Install the Summit Events App

You will receive an install URL the day of testing.  
Instructions:

1. Log in to your developer org (`login.salesforce.com`).
2. Use the provided URL to install the package.
3. Choose **Install for Admins Only**.
4. Open the **Summit Events** app from the App Launcher.
5. Confirm package components (tabs, objects) are present.

---

## 🛠 Step 2: App Setup

Follow the official documentation to set up the app:  
🔗 [Installation & Setup Instructions + Video](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/Getting-Started/Installing/)

Required setup includes:

- Creation of **Custom Settings** and **Custom Metadata**
- Assignment of **Permission Sets** to your user
- **Cloning the guest user permission set** and updating it to include **Read Access to the Account object** (if testing Experience Cloud or guest forms)
- Confirmation that **Summit Event** and **Summit Event Instance** tabs are visible

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Person Account Matching

Follow this guide:  
🔗 [Contact & Person Account Matching Configuration](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/advanced-features/Contact-Matching/)

Steps to configure:

1. **Create a Matching Rule** for Person Accounts (e.g., Email, First Name, Last Name).
2. **Create and activate a Duplicate Rule** tied to the matching rule.
3. Confirm the Summit Event record has matching logic enabled (via checkbox/field to not skip logic).
4. Matching will trigger **automatically** when a registration creates or links a Person Account.

---

## 📅 Step 4: Create a Summit Event and Event Instance

1. Go to the **Summit Event** tab.
2. Create a new Summit Event:
   - Fill in all required fields (e.g., Event Name, Start Date).
   - Confirm “Do Not Skip Matching” logic is **unchecked**.
3. From the related list or tab, create a **Summit Event Instance**:
   - Set values such as Capacity, Dates, and Registration Settings.

---

## 👥 Step 5: Register and Trigger Matching

1. On the Summit Event Instance record, click **“Register”**.
2. Fill out the registration form to create a new registrant.
3. Repeat the process using a similar record (same or slightly different name/email) to test matching.

The system will:

- Create a **new Person Account** if no match is found
- Match to an **existing Person Account** if one qualifies
- Detect **multiple potential matches**, select the best fit, and reflect the result

All results will be visible on the **Summit Event Registration record**, including:

- Whether a match occurred
- Whether a new Person Account was created
- A **table view of matching context**

**Scenarios to test:**

- Exact match (same name/email)
- Fuzzy match (email typo or swapped name order)
- No match (completely new person)
- Match against both:
   - Test-created Person Accounts
   - System-generated or imported Person Accounts
- Try registering with a non-Person Account record type (to ensure it’s ignored)

## 🧪 Step 6: Validate Event Functionality

🔗 [Standard Features](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/standard-features/)  
🔗 [Advanced Features](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/advanced-features/)  
🔗 [Custom Metadata Field Mapping for Matching](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/advanced-features/Contact-Matching/#custom-metadata-for-field-mapping)

Please test:

- ✅ RSVP flow (Can a user register without errors?)
- ✅ Capacity limits (Does it stop or waitlist users once full?)
- ✅ Transactional emails (Are they triggered properly?)
- ✅ Custom metadata mapping for field-level matching (Does mapping behave as expected?)
- ✅ Creation of Participation or related records (Are all child records created appropriately?)
