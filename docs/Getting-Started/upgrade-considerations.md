# Upgrade Considerations

Always reference the lastest [Release Notes](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/release-notes/) when upgrading to a new version.  Note that there were important changes in version 37.0.2. If you are upgrading from a version prior to 37.0.2, you will want to follow the instructions in the [37.0.2 release notes](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/release-notes/37-0-2/) related to sharing rules then move on to any additional items for the version to which you are upgrading.
